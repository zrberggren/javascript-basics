// Ternery Operators in JavaScript provide a shorthand way to write conditional statements. The syntax is as follows:

// if a customer has more than 100 points,
// they are a 'gold' customer, otherwise,
// they are a 'silver' customer.

let points = 90;
let type = points > 100 ? "gold" : "silver";

console.log(type);
